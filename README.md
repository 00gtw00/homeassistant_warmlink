# homeassistant_warmlink
Warmlink is a custom Home Assistant integration for Warmlink/LinkedGo heat pumps. It logs in to the cloud, reads status and temperatures (Outlet is current temp), lets you set target temperature, and turn heating on/off. Use the main cloud account in HA; the mobile app should use a separate email with a shared Home to avoid single-login kicks. OK!!
